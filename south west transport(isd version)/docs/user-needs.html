  <strong>Process impact:</strong> The statement of
  user needs documents and explains the actual desires of stakeholders
  in roughly their own words.  What they <i>desire</i> is never exactly
  what the product <i>provides</i>.  Documenting user needs here,
  independently from the <a href="srs.html">SRS</a>, helps to keep the
  SRS precise and makes the tasks of verification and validation more
  effective.  This document is <em>not</em> an informal draft of the
  SRS, it is different document with a complementary purpose.

 <h3>Agreed Goals</h3>

  a hyperlink.  If not, you should summarize your understanding of the

  to agree to it.  The text below gives three alternative examples,
  select one, or write your own.

  <!-- change me..

  List and describe the stakeholders for this product.  These
  can be named individuals or roles that people play.  For each
  stakeholder, list/rank their key needs.  Consider the expected
  technical expertise of the stakeholders and how often they are
  likely to use the system, as well as key strengths, weaknesses,
  preferences, or other characteristics.  Use a greater-than sign to
  indicate inheritance among types of actors.
 </div>

 <div class="tip">
  TIP: To get information on types of users, you can talk to actual
  users.  You may also want to talk to user surrogates (people who
  work with users), such as domain experts, technical trainers,
  technical support staff, technical writers, supervisors of users,
  and your own sales and marketing department.  You can find clues in
  manuals and marketing materials for competing products.

  this lack of information he has been late and deeply wishes to be on time to 
  his lectures.

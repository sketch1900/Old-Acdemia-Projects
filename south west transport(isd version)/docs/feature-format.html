<h3>Feature Attribute Values</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Priority
  <ul>

   <li>Essential: The system could not or would never be used without
   this feature.  It would be much harder to test, document, or
   package the product without this feature.</li>

   <li>Expected: Key stakeholders strongly desire and expect this
   feature.  It may have been promised to them in a certain release.
   It's absence would substantially reduce the success of the
   project.</li>

   <li>Desired: Stakeholders desire this feature.  It's absence would
   reduce the success of the project.</li>

   <li>Optional: This feature would be nice to have.  Adding it could
   have some advantage, but delaying it would not have a big effect on
   the success of the project.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <li>Effort
  <ul>
   <li>Months: A very large feature that is too big to estimate and
   should be broken in to smaller, better-defined features.</li>

   <li>Weeks: A large feature that will take 40 to 160 hours to add.</li>

   <li>Days: An average or easy feature that would take less than 40 hours to add.</li>

   <li>Hours: A very easy feature that would take less than 8 hours to add</li>

   <li>Note that "adding" a feature means doing all of it's design,
   implementation, technical documentation, user documentation, and
   testing.  Even the easiest feature takes hours to add.</li>

  </ul>
 </li>

 <li>Risk
  <ul>
   <li>Dangerous: Implementing this feature successfully would require
   overcoming risk factors that are more than three or unknown in
   number. It should be broken down into parts, better specified, or
   risk factors should be eliminated prior to implementation.</li>

   <li>3-Risks: Implementing this feature would require three risk
   factors to be overcome.  Any single release should contain at most
   a few such high-risk features, and contingency plans should be
   considered. You should be able to list the risks.</li>

   <li>2-Risks: Implementing this feature would require two risk
   factors to be overcome. This is normal for challenging
   features. You should be able to list the risks.</li>

   <li>1-Risk: Implementing this feature as specified would require
   one risk factor to be overcome.  This is normal for many features.
   You should be able to describe the risk.</li>

   <li>Safe: Implementing this feature as specified is just a matter
   of time and effort, there is no real risk of failure.</li>

   <li>A "risk factor" is a task or fact that is currently in doubt,
   but that must turn out well in order for the feature to be
   successfully implemented.  See tips on managing risk below. </li>

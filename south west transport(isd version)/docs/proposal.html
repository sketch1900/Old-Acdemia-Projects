  <strong>Process impact:</strong> This proposal,
  along with drafts of related documents, will be used by management to
  determine whether or not to approve work on this project.  A clear
  and precise project plan helps set expectations that will be used
  later to evaluate the success of the project.

 <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>

 <!--
 <div class="todo">
  TODO: Replace the example text below with text that describes your
  project.  What are the needs or problems that you are trying to
  address?  Why do these needs (still) exist?  Why are these problems
  worth solving?  Who is the customer?  Write 2-4 paragraphs. 
 </div>
-->

 <dl> 

  <dt>What is the setting and history behind this project?</dt> 
 
  <dd class="sample1">Public transport has existed since the day of horse and cart
  with people relying on it everyday it can become difficult for its users to find
  the timetables for these vehicles. However there has been improvements over
  the course of its vast history including dynamic timetables at some stops
  and busses/trains notifying its users of the upcomining stop name.
  </dd>

  <dt>What is the problem to be addressed?</dt> 
  
  <dd class="sample1">The modernization of transport hasnt been
  precise enough leaving a great gap in the information that some of
  the older stop/pickup points do not have. Therefore there is a need
  to provide people with this information as fast and precise as possible.
  </dd>

  <dt>What are some current approaches to this problem?</dt> 
 
  <dd class="sample1">Users could also use the internet to search for the
  timetables but this information can be buired under the service providers
  own machinations and advertisements but this information is not always
  up todate.
 
  <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.wessexbus.com/">Example of travel agency site</a></li>
  </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>Why is this problem worth solving or worth solving better?</dt> 
 
  <dd class="sample1">The problem is worth solving because over half a trillon
  people commute via one of the many public transport modes. While some improvements 
  have been made the vast majority is still left in the dark. The beneift to us
  would come in the form of revenue from advertisements, and fees for improvements to the
  app.</dd>

  <dt>How will this product be better than previous approaches?</dt> 
 
  <dd class="sample3">Our system will have similar functionality, but
  it is specifically aimed at a market segment that is not 
  served by competing products.</dd>

  <dt>Where is there more information on this problem?</dt> 
 
  <!-- <dd>The following pages provide additional background and
  motivation:

 <h3>Goal</h3>
 <dl>

  <dt>What is the goal of this project?</dt>
 
 <!-- <div class="tip">
   TIP: This should be relatively short since you can reference terms
   defined above.
  </div> -->
 
  <dd class="sample1">This project will produce an web app
  that will allow the selection of options to produce timetables
  for stops that the user can define and then define what timetable they would like visible.</dd>
 
  <dt>What are the defining features and benefits of this product?</dt>
 
  <dd>
  <ul class="sample1">
   <li>The web app will use a framework, this allows the pages to be highly
   customizable and inter-changeable.</li>
 
   <li>Because the web app uses the express framework for core behind the scenes of the web app can be changed
   and improved/replaced without it affecting the state of the veiw that the users will receive.</li>
 
   <li>The website engine will be secure and only allow administration with the
   proper permissions to edit, delete information.</li>
  </ul>

  project?</dt>

 <h3>Scope</h3>

 <h3>Risks and Rewards</h3>

   TODO: Briefly list and rank major risks.  Risks are detailed in the
   draft <a href="plan.html">project plan</a>.  For this proposal
   document, you should select the most important risks from the
   project plan and explain them in non-technical terms.
  </div>
-->

  <dt>What are the main risks of this project?</dt>
 
  <dd class="sample1">
   <ol>
    <li>There is a potential conflict between the goals of a
	highly customizable web app and the speed of the app.
	We can only succeed if the app appear simple to use, understand and
	provides precise and concise information. While Administration can customize
	it with no more effort than would be needed to build a static website.
	</li>
  
    <li>There are significant technical difficulties in building a web
    site and web application.  This will be a risk because one person on
    our team has much experience with the relevant tools and
    technologies.  Although the others will learn, we will certainly
    make some mistakes and suboptimal choices.  We will address this
    risk by scoping the project such that we have enough time to train
    and to review the design and implementation.</li>
  
    <li>The schedule for this project is very short.  We will manage
    this by planning a conservatively scoped functional core and series
    of functional enhancements that can be individually slipped to later
    releases if needed.</li>
   </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt>What are the main rewards if this project succeeds?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">If we accomplish the elements of our plan, our
  web app will overcome and eventualy overtake its competitors.
  Our ability to overcome the challenges above will determine
  time to market, the speed of adoption, the amount of web traffic,
  and thus the generated revenue over time.</dd>
